# amicable_numbers
Python program to find amicable numbers within a range
Two numbers are classified as amicable numbers if the sum of proper divisors of one number is equal to the other number, and vice versa. For example, 220 and 280 are amicable numbers for the above-mentioned reason.
220 - 1+2+4+5+10+11+20+22+44+55+110 = 284
284 - 1+2+4+71+142 = 220
